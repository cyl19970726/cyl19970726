- Now I am working for [bitlayer](https://github.com/bitlayer-org) to implemente the verifier of bf-stark on bitcoin use bitvm2 paradigm.

- I am also a core contributor for [eigen-zkvm](https://github.com/0xEigenLabs/eigen-zkvm), the most interesting work I think is to complete Stark's aggregate circuit and the corresponding shell.

- For the past two years I have been working at [EthStorage](https://github.com/ethstorage), I have completed some work based on smart contract and blockchain development, including but not limited to independently implementing the development of sidechain cross-chain bridges, embedding cross-chain call modules in tendermint consensus, and participating in the development of Ethstorage's storage proof.

- In 2023, I also collaborated with three friends to create [git3](https://github.com/git3protocol), a decentralized storage platform based on blockchain. Git3 functions similarly to Git, but it ensures that all your files are stored on a decentralized platform.
